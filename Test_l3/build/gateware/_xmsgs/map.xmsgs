<msg type="error" file="Pack" num="2811" delta="new" >Directed packing was unable to obey the user design constraints <arg fmt="%z" index="1">(LOC=B13) which requires the combination of the symbols listed below to be packed into a single IOB33 component.

The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
The symbols involved are:
	BUF symbol &quot;out_probe0_OBUF&quot; (Output Signal = out_probe0)
	PAD symbol &quot;out_probe0.PAD&quot; (Pad Signal = out_probe0)
	PAD symbol &quot;LCD_Parallel0&lt;0&gt;&quot; (Pad Signal = LCD_Parallel0&lt;0&gt;)</arg>
